# Tevisian

Tevisian is a deprecated Linux-based desktop environment which was going to be designed for TV uses, such as:
<ul>
    <li>Smart TVs</li>
    <li>TV Boxes</li>
    <li>Home Theater PC</li>
</ul>

# Why C#?

Truth be told, I was going to use C++ and Rust with SDL2,
<br>but I noticed C# gave me the least friction of all three.

# Why is it deprecated?

Simply put, I'd decided that, if I were to do this anyway,
<br>I would just support Plasma Bigscreen instead.
